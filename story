Once upon a time, in a forest there lived a monkey who decided on a berry tree which was on the banks of a river. 
In the same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife.
One day, the crocodile came to the bank of the river and rested under the shade of a tree. The kind-hearted monkey offered him some scrumptious berries.
The following day, the crocodile came back for more berries as he loved them. 
As days passed by, the monkey and the crocodile eventually became closer.
